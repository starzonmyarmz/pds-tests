Porchlight Coding Performance Exercise

This is a coding exercise test to roughly gauge how much time an engineer could save when having access to Porchlight vs not having access. A simple wireframe is provided below of a very basic Todo list app, but having the ability to track time, and delete items from the list. Very little effort was put into UX, and there are definitely shortcomings to this design/layout, but that's ok!
